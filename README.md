# What is this project about ?

This project combine data recorded by a Garmin Watch and an HRM Run belt during an Half Marathon event in Finland.
The whole dataset could be found in data.world : https://data.world/jarnoma/half-marathon/workspace/project-summary?agentid=jarnoma&datasetid=half-marathon

# Description

The dataset contains 5915 rows and 10 features in total. The features are the following :
- **datetime** : datetime when the data was recorded
- **latitude** : latitude where the data was recorded
- **longitude** : longitude where the data was recorded
- **location**: geometric coordinates that combine longitude and latitude
- **altitude** : altitude where the data was recorded
- **distance** : distance traveled from start in meters
- **heartrate** : heartrate of the runner recorded for this specific moment
- **speed** : speed of the runner in m/s

# Objectives

With this dataset we will analyze how metrics evolve throughout the race :
- How does the **heart rate** evolves over time ?
- How does the **speed** changes over time ?
- What is the **influence of the altitude** on the speed and heartbeat ?
